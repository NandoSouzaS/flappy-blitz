Flappy Blitz started with the intent of create a "flappy bird-like" game, where the player used a tank to go through barricades of sandbags, as the bird in Flappy Bird does with the pipes.
Since the pre-production, i wasn't considering it worth to pubblish, I saw it more like a learning prototype.
This said, I'm making this project public, now that i moved on from it.
I'm also releasing it in my itch.io page, whitch can be found on my profile, so everyone that interested on trying it can play for free.
