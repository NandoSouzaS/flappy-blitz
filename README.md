​Flappy Blitz started with the intent of create a "flappy bird-like" game, where the player used a tank to go through barricades of sandbags, as the bird in Flappy Bird does with the pipes. Since the pre-production, I wasn't considering it worth to publish, I saw it more like a learning prototype. This said, I'm making this project public, now that i moved on from it. I'm also releasing it in my itch.io page, which can be found on my profile, so everyone that interested on trying it can play for free.​
